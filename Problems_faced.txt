At first I tried to run the application in local machine, npm didn't install due to the outdated package.json (dependencies).

Also the code seems to be outdated updating the code to latest version will improve the code quality and application performance.

Planning to set up the infra was the difficult part.

Since I am more familiar with EKS, ECR I chose to deploy application in Elastic Kubernetes Service.
